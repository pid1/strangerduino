Stranger Things Christmas Lights Communicator

## Description
Built for a family member's Halloween display, this allows for displaying arbitrary "words" as highlighted by an appropriately numbered LED light, as well as a randomized "Christmas" mode.

This assumes a LED light string supported by the [FastLED](https://fastled.io/) library.
